We use _EXPLAIN_ to understand the query plan from our queries, these plans are build based on the DB stats. _EXPLAIN_ supports multiples https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-explain.html[options] it is important to remember the option _ANALYZE_ is a profiler and execute the query against the DB so it has impact in performance.

== Hands On

Postgres builds a tree structure of plan nodes representing the different actions taken, with the root and each -> pointing to one of them. In some cases EXPLAIN ANALYZE provides additional execution statistics beyond the execution times and row counts, such as Sort and Hash above. Any line other than the first without an -> is such information, so the structure of the query is:

```
Sort
└── Hash Join
    ├── Seq Scan
    └── Hash
        └── Bitmap Heap Scan
            └── Bitmap Index Scan
```

Each tree’s branches represent sub-actions, and you’d work inside-out to determine what’s happening “first” (though the order of nodes at the same level could be different).

=== Basic Understanding

1) Execute query

```
SELECT * FROM film;
```

2) Analyze query

```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film;
```

3) Understand query plan

[options="nowrap"]
```
                        QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..65.00 rows=1000 width=386)
(1 row)
```

From the above query plan we can learn a couple of things.

1. Seq Scan: Meaning there will be full scan in the table `film`
2. Estimate Cost: `0.00..65.00` Those are the estimate cost as initial cost and final cost.
3. Rows: Estimate number of rows.
4. width: Estimate size in bytes of the returned rows.

We can compute the cost in the following way:

`Cost = (disk pages read * seq_page_cost) + (rows scanned * cpu_tuple_cost)`

Lets do some math

[options="nowrap"]
```
SELECT
    relpages AS "Disk Page Read",
    reltuples AS "Rows Scanned"
FROM
    pg_class
WHERE
    relname = 'film';

Disk Page Read | Rows Scanned
----------------+--------------
             55 |         1000
(1 row)
```

Relative cost of accesing a page
[options="nowrap"]
```
SHOW seq_page_cost;

 seq_page_cost
---------------
 1
(1 row)
```

Relative cost of processing a row
[options="nowrap"]
```
SHOW cpu_tuple_cost;

 cpu_tuple_cost
----------------
 0.01
(1 row)
```

Cost = (55 * 1) + (1000 * 0.01) = 55 + 10 = 65

*Note:* There are other relative costs that the query planner use when computing the final cost.

* Indexes related: _random_page_cost_ (Random Access), _cpu_index_tuple_cost_ (Processing Rows)
* Parallel worker related: _parallel_tuple_cost_ (Transfer tuples to other worker), _parallel_setup_cost_ (Start new worker)
* Filter related: _cpu_operator_cost_ (Processing each operator or function)

=== Seq Scan Vs Index Scan

1) Check indexes

```
\d film
```

*Note:* Check the column `film_id` is the primary key and has a btree index.

2) Understand query plan 1

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id < 40;

                                QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using film_pkey on film  (cost=0.28..11.11 rows=40 width=386)
   Index Cond: (film_id < 40)
(2 rows)
```

*Analysis:* In this case the query planner decided to do an index scan using `film_pkey` applying the condition over the index, this lead to a lower cost.

3) Understand query plan 2

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id > 40;

                       QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..67.50 rows=960 width=386)
   Filter: (film_id > 40)
(2 rows)
```

*Analysis:* If we remember the total cost from our previous lab `0.00..65.00` it could sound weird that now we are fetching less rows but having a higher cost, this is due to because we are fetching 1000 rows and later applying a filter.

We can compute the extra cost, using the value of _cpu_operator_cost_

[options="nowrap"]
```
SHOW cpu_operator_cost;

 cpu_operator_cost
-------------------
 0.0025
(1 row)
```

```
Cost = Seq Scan Cost + Filter Cost
Cost = 65 + (1000 * 0.0025)
Cost = 65 + 2.5
Cost = 67.5
```

4) Why different plans?

It could some weird that when doing a query using an indexed field the planner decided to do a _Seq Scan_ rather than an _Index Scan_ this is due to the planner understand that the second query is going to fetch several rows so it will have to fetch several pages no matter if using the index or not.

5) Additional conditions

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id < 40 AND rating = 'PG-13';

                               QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using film_pkey on film  (cost=0.28..11.21 rows=9 width=386)
   Index Cond: (film_id < 40)
   Filter: (rating = 'PG-13'::mpaa_rating)
(3 rows)
```

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id > 40 AND rating = 'PG-13';

                           QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..70.00 rows=214 width=386)
   Filter: ((film_id > 40) AND (rating = 'PG-13'::mpaa_rating))
(2 rows)
```

*Analysis:* If we check the first plan we will see the index is still used and the filter is applied over the result after using the _Index Scan_. In the second case the plan remains very similar to the original but adding some extra condition to the filter clause.

=== Analyze

1) Understand explain options

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id > 40;

                QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on public.film  (cost=0.00..67.50 rows=960 width=386) (actual time=0.027..0.265 rows=960 loops=1)
   Output: film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, original_language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, last_update, special_features, fulltext
   Filter: (film.film_id > 40)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 40
   Buffers: shared hit=55
 Planning time: 0.117 ms
 Execution time: 0.370 ms
(7 rows)
```

We have multiples options for _EXPLAIN_:

* ANALYZE: Carry out the command and show actual run times and other statistics.
* VERBOSE: Display additional information regarding the plan.
* BUFFERS: Show buffers usage (Hit means read from buffer, Read means read from disk).

=== Indexes

1) Analyze query

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length FROM film WHERE length = 60;

                                           QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..67.50 rows=6 width=17) (actual time=0.038..0.274 rows=8 loops=1)
   Filter: (length = 60)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 992
 Planning time: 0.100 ms
 Execution time: 0.287 ms
(6 rows)
```

2) Create index

[options="nowrap"]
```
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_length ON film (length);
```

3) Analyze query

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length FROM film WHERE length = 60;

                                                       QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=4.32..22.45 rows=6 width=17) (actual time=0.025..0.036 rows=8 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: (length = 60)
   Heap Blocks: exact=8
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_length  (cost=0.00..4.32 rows=6 width=0) (actual time=0.018..0.018 rows=8 loops=1)
         Index Cond: (length = 60)
 Planning time: 0.268 ms
 Execution time: 0.054 ms
(9 rows)
```

*Analysis:* Maybe we were expecting to see an _Index Scan_ but we found a _Bitmap Index Scan_, we can think of a bitmap index scan as a middle ground between a sequential scan and an index scan.

[options="header"]
|===
|Type|Index Scan|Bitmap Index Scan
|Operation|Index scan reads the index in alternation, bouncing between table and index, row at a time.|Scans all index rows before examining base table.This populates a TID (Tuple Identifier) bitmap. TID is 6 bytes number which consists of two parts. The first part is 4-byte page number and remaining 2 bytes tuple index inside the page. The combination of these two numbers uniquely points to the storage location for a particular tuple
|Scan Property|Random I/O against the base table. Read a row from the index, then a row from the table, and so on.|Table I/O is sequential, results in physical order.
|===

After building our bitmap _Bitmap Heap Scan_ will looks up the relevant data. Each chunk of a bitmap can either be exact (pointing directly to rows) or lossy (pointing to a page containing at least one row matching the predicate).
Postgres prefers using exact blocks, but if limited `work_mem (SHOW work_mem)` is an issue, it will start using lossy blocks as well.

4) Drop index

[options="nowrap"]
```
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length;
```

=== Multicolumn Indexes

In some scenarios we could want to create an index compose of multiples columns, we need to remember the following:

* Maximun 32 columns
* Column order matter (Leading column constraint)
* Usually multiples single indexes work better (Run performance)

1) Analyze query

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                            QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..72.50 rows=13 width=34) (actual time=0.032..0.362 rows=18 loops=1)
   Filter: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70) AND (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 982
 Planning time: 0.122 ms
 Execution time: 0.378 ms
(5 rows)
```

2) Create single column index and re-execute query

[options="nowrap"]
```
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_length ON film (length);

EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                                        QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=4.99..64.17 rows=13 width=34) (actual time=0.045..0.101 rows=18 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
   Filter: (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 59
   Heap Blocks: exact=41
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_length  (cost=0.00..4.99 rows=71 width=0) (actual time=0.027..0.027 rows=77 loops=1)
         Index Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
 Planning time: 0.313 ms
 Execution time: 0.122 ms
(9 rows)
```

3) Create multi column index and re-execute query

[options="nowrap"]
```
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_length_rating ON film (length,rating);

EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                                           QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=5.17..36.58 rows=13 width=34) (actual time=0.044..0.089 rows=18 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70) AND (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating))
   Heap Blocks: exact=14
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_length_rating  (cost=0.00..5.16 rows=13 width=0) (actual time=0.035..0.035 rows=18 loops=1)
         Index Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70) AND (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating))
 Planning time: 0.274 ms
 Execution time: 0.122 ms
(7 rows)
```

4) Order matters

The most important consideration when defining a concatenated index is how to choose the column order so it can be used as often as possible.

[options="nowrap"]
```
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_length_rating ON film (length,rating);
```

Lets compare the query plan for the following queries:

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                                           QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=5.00..64.00 rows=71 width=34) (actual time=0.037..0.100 rows=77 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
   Heap Blocks: exact=41
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_length_rating  (cost=0.00..4.99 rows=71 width=0) (actual time=0.027..0.027 rows=77 loops=1)
         Index Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
 Planning time: 0.410 ms
 Execution time: 0.128 ms
(7 rows)
```

[options="nowrap"]
```
EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                             QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..67.50 rows=178 width=34) (actual time=0.011..0.336 rows=178 loops=1)
   Filter: (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 822
 Planning time: 0.119 ms
 Execution time: 0.358 ms
(5 rows)
```

*Analysis:* In the first case the index can be used because we are filtering by the first column of the index but in the second case this is not possible because the index requires first filtering by _length_ and we are not using _length_ in our where clause.

5) Compare with two single indexes

[options="nowrap"]
```
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_rating;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length_rating;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_length ON film (length);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_film_rating ON film (rating);

EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                                            QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=10.85..42.26 rows=13 width=34) (actual time=0.082..0.100 rows=18 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70) AND (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating))
   Heap Blocks: exact=14
   ->  BitmapAnd  (cost=10.85..10.85 rows=13 width=0) (actual time=0.075..0.075 rows=0 loops=1)
         ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_length  (cost=0.00..4.99 rows=71 width=0) (actual time=0.029..0.029 rows=77 loops=1)
               Index Cond: ((length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
         ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_film_rating  (cost=0.00..5.61 rows=178 width=0) (actual time=0.040..0.040 rows=178 loops=1)
               Index Cond: (rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating)
 Planning time: 0.272 ms
 Execution time: 0.135 ms
(10 rows)
```

*Analysis:* In this case we can confirm a single index in both column perform worst for this particular query.

We can use this query plan to understand more about _BitmapAnd_ and _BitmapOr_.

* BitmapAnd: Generate a bitmap of the intersection of two physical row location bitmaps (that is, only locations that occur in both bitmaps). The bitmaps can come from Bitmap Index Scans or other BitmapOr or BitmapAnd child nodes.
* BitmapOr: Generate a bitmap of the union of two physical row location bitmaps (that is, locations that occur in either bitmap). The bitmaps can come from Bitmap Index Scans or other BitmapOr or BitmapAnd child nodes.

In both cases due to internal implementation limitations, these nodes do not track the number of rows they produce. Their row count will always be listed as "Unknown" (0) and they will not be flagged as mis-estimates.

7) Index Only Scan (Cover Index)

A covering index is one which can satisfy all requested columns in a query without performing a further lookup into the clustered index.

[options="nowrap"]
```
CREATE INDEX idx_film_rating_length_cover ON film (rating,length,title,replacement_cost,rental_rate);

EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT title, length, rating, replacement_cost, rental_rate FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 70 AND rating = 'G';

                                                                QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Only Scan using idx_film_rating_length_cover on film  (cost=0.28..4.57 rows=13 width=21) (actual time=0.014
   Index Cond: ((rating = 'G'::mpaa_rating) AND (length >= 60) AND (length <= 70))
   Heap Fetches: 0
 Planning time: 0.230 ms
 Execution time: 0.067 ms
(5 rows)
```

*Analysis:* Given the fact the index contains all the neccesary fields the query does not need to fetch data from table so it is using _Index Only Scan_. If you do not get this plan, it could be due to statistics run _VACUUM film;_ and _ANALYZE film;_

6) Clean up

[options="nowrap"]
```
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_rating;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_length_rating;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_rating_length;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_film_rating_length_cover;
```
